# story2sketch ðŸ’Ž

Convert [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) stories into [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com) symbols.

> Uses the amazing and experimental [`html-sketchapp`](https://github.com/brainly/html-sketchapp). Only supports web.

## Quickstart

Firstly, get [Sketch](https://sketchapp.com) and [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Then install [`asketch2sketch.sketchplugin`](https://github.com/brainly/html-sketchapp/releases/download/v3.2.0/asketch2sketch-3-2-0.sketchplugin.zip) into Sketch:

Install `story2sketch`:

```sh
npm i story2sketch -g
```

Now navigate to your Storybook 3.3.x project. You'll want to [take full control of your Storybook webpack.config.js](https://storybook.js.org/configurations/custom-webpack-config/#full-control-mode) if you haven't already done so, adding:

```js
module.exports = (storybookBaseConfig, configType) => {
  const newConfig = {
    ...storybookBaseConfig
  };

  // Add this:
  // Export bundles as libraries so we can access them on page scope.
  newConfig.output.library = "[name]";

  return newConfig;
}
```

Manually export the `getStorybook` function in your `./config/storybook/config.js` file:

```js
import { getStorybook } from "@storybook/react";

...

export { getStorybook }
```

Run story2sketch, pointing towards a Storybook iframe URL. See [configuration](#configuration) for more options, or if you have a lot of stories.

```sh
story2sketch --url https://localhost:9001/iframe.html --output stories.asketch.json
```

Import the generated file into Sketch via `Plugins > From *Almost* Sketch to Sketch` in Sketch menu bar.

Success!

## Why?

As stated by [`react-sketchapp`](https://github.com/airbnb/react-sketchapp), it's complicated to manage assets in a design system. Many teams building design systems or component libraries already produce Sketch files for distributing designs and use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) to prototype and present the developed components. It can become difficult to keep designs up to date with the latest components, with designers ever playing catchup. `story2sketch` generates a Sketch file from your components via Storybook, so your Sketch designs always stay up to date.

## Configuration

You can configure `story2sketch` using [the API](#api) via the CLI, configuring your `package.json` or adding a `story2sketch.config.js` file.

### CLI

Simply call `story2sketch` with options from the [API](#api).

```sh
$ story2sketch --stories all --output dist/great-ui.asketch.json
```

### package.json

Add the following to your package.json:

```json
{
  "story2sketch": {
    "stories": "all",
    "output": "dist/great-ui.asketch.json"
  }
}

```

### story2sketch.config.js

Create a file called `story2sketch.config.js` on the root of your project:

```js
module.exports = {
  output: "dist/great-ui.asketch.json",
  stories: "all"
}
```

## Questions

### Why does my stuff look bad?

Because this project is experimental, and so is it's [core dependency](https://github.com/brainly/html-sketchapp). If your stuff looks bad, either it's not supported by [`html-sketchapp`](https://github.com/brainly/html-sketchapp) yet (see [support here](https://github.com/brainly/html-sketchapp/wiki/What's-supported%3F)), or you need to [configure story2sketch](#configuration).

### Why don't you use `react-sketchapp` instead of `html-sketchapp`?

[`react-sketchapp`](https://github.com/airbnb/react-sketchapp) only supports React Native, or forces you to use React Native component naming conventions. [`html-sketchapp`](https://github.com/brainly/html-sketchapp) supports good ol' fashioned HTML, and doesn't care what web framework you're using.

### Can I use this on anything other than Storybook?

Not yet, but we have plans to add support for multiple and custom adaptors.
