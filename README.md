# story2sketch ðŸ’Ž

Convert [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) stories into [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com) symbols.

> Uses the amazing and experimental [`html-sketchapp`](https://github.com/brainly/html-sketchapp). Only supports web.

## Quickstart

Firstly, get [Sketch](https://sketchapp.com) and [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Then install [`asketch2sketch.sketchplugin`](https://github.com/brainly/html-sketchapp/releases/download/v4.0.0/asketch2sketch-4-0-0.sketchplugin.zip) into Sketch:

Install `story2sketch`:

```sh
npm i story2sketch -g
```

Run `story2sketch`, pointing towards a Storybook iframe URL. See [configuration](#configuration) for more options, or if you have a lot of stories.

```sh
story2sketch --url https://localhost:9001/iframe.html --output stories.asketch.json
```

Import the generated file into Sketch via `Plugins > From *Almost* Sketch to Sketch` in Sketch menu bar.

Success!

### Storybook 3.x

If you're using Storybook 3.3 or above (but not Storybook 4), you'll want to [take full control of your Storybook webpack.config.js](https://storybook.js.org/configurations/custom-webpack-config/#full-control-mode) if you haven't already done so, adding:

```js
module.exports = (storybookBaseConfig, configType) => {
  const newConfig = {
    ...storybookBaseConfig
  };

  // Add this:
  // Export bundles as libraries so we can access them on page scope.
  newConfig.output.library = "[name]";

  return newConfig;
};
```

Manually export the `getStorybook` function in your `./config/storybook/config.js` file:

```js
import { getStorybook } from "@storybook/react";

...

export { getStorybook }
```

Run story2sketch:

```sh
story2sketch --url https://localhost:9001/iframe.html --output stories.asketch.json
```

## Why?

As stated by [`react-sketchapp`](https://github.com/airbnb/react-sketchapp), it's complicated to manage assets in a design system. Many teams building design systems or component libraries already produce Sketch files for distributing designs and use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) to prototype and present the developed components. It can become difficult to keep designs up to date with the latest components, with designers ever playing catchup. `story2sketch` generates a Sketch file from your components via Storybook, so your Sketch designs always stay up to date.

## Configuration

You can configure `story2sketch` using [the API](#api) via the CLI, configuring your `package.json` or adding a `story2sketch.config.js` file.

### CLI

Simply call `story2sketch` with options from the [API](#api).

```sh
$ story2sketch --stories all --output dist/great-ui.asketch.json
```

### package.json

Add the following to your package.json:

```json
{
  "story2sketch": {
    "stories": "all",
    "output": "dist/great-ui.asketch.json"
  }
}
```

### story2sketch.config.js

Create a file called `story2sketch.config.js` on the root of your project:

```js
module.exports = {
  output: "dist/great-ui.asketch.json",
  stories: "all"
};
```

| input               | The location of Storybook's generated iframe.html.

| stories             | Stories to extract from Storybook.

| viewports           | Viewport configuration. Will be arranged left-to-right by width. Try to avoid changing the key, as this is used to identify the symbol.                                        | object        | Mobile viewport (320px wide) and desktop viewport (1920px wide).

  output: "dist/great-ui.asketch.json",
  input: "dist/iframe.html",
  concurrency: 2,
  symbolGutter: 200,
  viewports: {
    narrow: {
      width: 320,
      height: 1200,
      symbolPrefix: "Mobile/"
    },
    standard: {

    {
      kind: "Buttons/Button",
      stories: [
        {
          name: "Button"

        {
          name: "Table"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
};
```

## Continuous Integration

If you want `story2sketch` to run in a CI environment you might have to add the following configuration to puppeteer in your `story2sketch.config.js`.

```js
module.exports = {
  puppeteerOptions: {
    args: ['--no-sandbox', '--disable-setuid-sandbox']
  },
  ...
};

```

## Questions

### Why does my stuff look bad?

Because this project is experimental, and so is it's [core dependency](https://github.com/brainly/html-sketchapp). If your stuff looks bad, either it's not supported by [`html-sketchapp`](https://github.com/brainly/html-sketchapp) yet (see [support here](https://github.com/brainly/html-sketchapp/wiki/What's-supported%3F)), or you need to [configure story2sketch](#configuration).

### Why don't you use `react-sketchapp` instead of `html-sketchapp`?

[`react-sketchapp`](https://github.com/airbnb/react-sketchapp) only supports React Native, or forces you to use React Native component naming conventions. [`html-sketchapp`](https://github.com/brainly/html-sketchapp) supports good ol' fashioned HTML, and doesn't care what web framework you're using.

### Can I use this on anything other than Storybook?

Not yet, but we have plans to add support for multiple and custom adaptors.
